# SMART-MONITORING-SYSTEM-IN-INDUSTRIES
Smart monitering system is an intelligent  management system. Monitoring the fullness of dangers through the use of sensors, it is possible to achieve a more efficient system than the current existing. Our idea of “Smart monitering system”, mainly concentrates on Monitoring thedangers or any disturbances caused like increase in excess of temp, poisinous gas detection and also identifying the person coming near the dangers.. The proposed idea can be implemented for smart cities where the manufacturing industries would increase in future.  This device can be implemented in a diserable industry, for benifial purpose.
